      Step Zero: Review But first let’s review some basic concepts. You can skip <br>
      this step if you already have a good idea of how React, JSX and DOM<br>
      elements work. We’ll use this React app, just three lines of code. The<br>
      first one defines a React element. The next one gets a node from the DOM.<br>
      The last one renders the React element into the container. Let’s remove<br>
      all the React specific code and replace it with vanilla JavaScript. On the<br>
      first line we have the element, defined with JSX. It isn’t even valid<br>
      JavaScript, so in order to replace it with vanilla JS, first we need to<br>
      replace it with valid JS. JSX is transformed to JS by build tools like<br>
      Babel. The transformation is usually simple: replace the code inside the<br>
      tags with a call to createElement, passing the tag name, the props and the<br>
      children as parameters. React.createElement creates an object from its<br>
      arguments. Besides some validations, that’s all it does. So we can safely<br>
      replace the function call with its output. And this is what an element is,<br>
      an object with two properties: type and props (well, it has more, but we<br>
      only care about these two). The type is a string that specifies the type<br>
      of the DOM node we want to create, it’s the tagName you pass to<br>
      document.createElement when you want to create an HTML element. It can<br>
      also be a function, but we’ll leave that for Step VII. props is another<br>
      object, it has all the keys and values from the JSX attributes. It also<br>
      has a special property: children. children in this case is a string, but<br>
      it’s usually an array with more elements. That’s why elements are also<br>
      trees. The other piece of React code we need to replace is the call to<br>
      ReactDOM.render. render is where React changes the DOM, so let’s do the<br>
      updates ourselves. First we create a node* using the element type, in this<br>
      case h1. Then we assign all the element props to that node. Here it’s just<br>
      the title. * To avoid confusion, I’ll use “element” to refer to React<br>
      elements and “node” for DOM elements. Then we create the nodes for the<br>
      children. We only have a string as a child so we create a text node. Using<br>
      textNode instead of setting innerText will allow us to treat all elements<br>
      in the same way later. Note also how we set the nodeValue like we did it<br>
      with the h1 title, it’s almost as if the string had props: {nodeValue:<br>
      "hello"}.Step Zero: Review But first let’s review some basic concepts. You<br>
