    <span>There is only one Home tag now, because I haven't figured out what to do. The default page imported by default
        is this one (referring to the right part). Switching page display based on the tag is very simple. I just need
        to
        plan. Just download the page and style to jump to</span>
    <br>
    Maybe this page will be added to the new daily tag
    <img src="./public/image/xitele.png" alt="" width="100px" height="100px"><br>
    I can even put pictures into text like this, which is much better than markdown. Our old-fashioned html has
    completely defeated the new markdown.

    <span>is same ... what i do <br> 
        It seemed like I had accomplished what I wanted for the first time, but it seemed to be of no use and had no impact on myself or the world.
