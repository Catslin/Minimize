            I'm struggling with
        javascript</a>
        <span>
            What I do seems not good
            enough / The video talks about directly learning the hook of react... It's like a service framework like
            express, but
            it doesn't work, so what should I do? I think I should still know what is done in react. I have both es6 and <a
                href="https://zh.javascript.info/">modern
                js</a> courses. Done, in fact... it would be better to study the principles while writing the react project. I
            also need
            NodeJ to help me.
