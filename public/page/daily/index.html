    I encountered a problem. I can't understand the English document, and I can't use Google Translate like now. It's
    too troublesome. I may need to build a program to translate PDF!

    <p>seems that I can't understand more things if I continue to write js. I still need to combine it with <a
            href="https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe">react</a>. I feel that I am almost out of motivation...
        and it is quite uncomfortable to be honest when there is no adaptability for writing things in js.</p>
    I really want to understand a lot of things at once, but I can only take my time. For me

            I'm struggling with
        javascript</a>
        <span>
            What I do seems not good
            enough / The video talks about directly learning the hook of react... It's like a service framework like
            express, but
            it doesn't work, so what should I do? I think I should still know what is done in react. I have both es6 and <a
                href=" https://zh.javascript.info/">modern
        js</a> courses. Done, in fact... it would be better to study the principles while writing the react project. I
    also need
    NodeJ to help me.
