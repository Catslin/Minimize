        <h5>Build own reactJS</h5>
        <a href="https://pomb.us/build-your-own-react/">this course in here</a>
        in top build a div as root
        <pre>
            const element = [h1 title="foo"]Hello [/h1]
            const container = document.getElementById("root")
            ReactDOM.render(element, container)
        </pre>
        Create a React element, get the DOM element with id "root", and use the ReactDOM.render() method to render the
        React element into the container
        but in fection
        <pre>
            const element = React.createElement(
                "h1",
                { title: "foo" },
                "Hello"
            )
        </pre>
        It just puts all the parameters into an object and returns
        <pre>
            const element = [h1 title="foo"]Hello [/h1]
        </pre>
        in this element has two property object
        <pre>
            const element = {
                type: "h1",
                props: {
                    title: "foo",
                    children: "Hello",
                },
            }
        </pre>
        type and props,and now we hava same as application as before
        <pre>
            const element = {
                type: "h1",
                props: {
                  title: "foo",
                  children: "Hello",
                },
              }
              const container = document.getElementById("root")
              const node = document.createElement(element.type)
              node["title"] = element.props.title
              const text = document.createTextNode("")
              text["nodeValue"] = element.props.children
              node.appendChild(text)
              container.appendChild(node)
        </pre>
        The createElement method in React and the naming of {type, props} are React's internal conventions and are used
        to represent the structure of React elements.

        Parameters to the createElement method include the element's type (e.g. "h1") and attribute object (e.g. {
        title: "foo" }), as well as optional child elements. This method is closer to the expression of JSX syntax.

        The naming method of {type, props} represents the type and attributes of the element more intuitively. type
        represents the type of element, such as "h1", and props is an object containing element attributes, including
        attributes such as title and children (or array attributes)..
