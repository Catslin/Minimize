<h2>About this PAGE</h2>
<div class="card">
  <h5>2023/10/25</h5>
  <span>There is only one Home tag now, because I haven't figured out what to do. The default page imported by default
    is this one (referring to the right part). Switching page display based on the tag is very simple. I just need to
    plan. Just download the page and style to jump to</span>
    <br>
    Maybe this page will be added to the new daily tag
    <img src="./public/image/xitele.png" alt="" width="100px" height="100px"><br>
    I can even put pictures into text like this, which is much better than markdown. Our old-fashioned html has completely defeated the new markdown.
    <p>说真的，中文字体是真的不行,找半天找不到英文这么多字体族样式😅因为都是要收费的捏</p>
