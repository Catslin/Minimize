    Here's what the Encyclopedia Galactica has to say about alcohol. It says that alcohol is a colourless volatile liquid formed by the fermentation of sugars and also notes its intoxicating effect on certain carbon-based life forms.

<p>The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy also mentions alcohol. It says that the best drink in existence is the <span class="marked">Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster</span>.</p>
<p>It says that the effect of a <span class="marked">Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster</span> is like having your brains smashed out by a slice of lemon wrapped round a large gold brick.</p>
<p>The Guide also tells you on which planets the best <span class="marked">Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters</span> are mixed, how much you can expect to pay for one and what voluntary organizations exist to help you rehabilitate afterwards.</p>
<p>The Guide even tells you how you can mix one yourself.</p>

Allow three cubes of Arcturan Mega-gin to melt into the mixture (it must be properly iced or the benzene is lost). <br>
Allow four litres of Fallian marsh gas to bubble through it, in memory of all those happy hikers who have died of pleasure in the Marshes of Fallia. <br>
Over the back of a silver spoon float a measure of Qualactin Hypermint extract, redolent of all the heady odours of the dark Qualactin Zones, subtle, sweet and mystic. <br>
Drop in the tooth of an Algolian Suntiger. Watch it dissolve, spreading the fires of the Algolian Suns deep into the heart of the drink. <br>

Add an olive.
Drink... but... very carefully...
